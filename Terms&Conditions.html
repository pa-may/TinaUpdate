      8. CONFIDENTIALITY
      <br /><br />

      8.1. Definition of Confidential Information. "Confidential Information"
      means all confidential or proprietary information of a party ("Disclosing
      Party") disclosed to the other party ("Receiving Party"), whether orally
      or in writing, that is designated as confidential or reasonably should be
      understood to be confidential given the nature of information and the
      circumstances of disclosure. Without limiting the coverage of these
      confidentiality obligations, the parties acknowledge and agree that
      Confidential Information of each party shall include the terms and
      conditions of this Agreement (including pricing and other terms set forth
      in all Order Forms and/or SOWs hereunder), related benchmark or similar
      test results, other technology and technical information, security
      information, security audit reports, and business and marketing plans,
      except that Tina Pokuaah Consultancy & Training may reference and use

      marketing efforts.
      <br /><br />

      8.2. Exceptions. Confidential Information shall not include information
      that (i) is or becomes publicly available without a breach of any
      obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, (ii) is already known to the
      Receiving Party at the time of its disclosure by the Disclosing Party,
      without a breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, (iii)
      following its disclosure to the Receiving Party, is received by the
      Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any obligation owed
      to Disclosing Party, or (iv) is independently developed by Receiving Party
      without reference to or use of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential
      Information.
      <br /><br />

      8.3. Protection of Confidential Information. The Receiving Party shall use
      the same degree of care used to protect the confidentiality of its own
      Confidential Information of like kind (but in no event less than
      reasonable care), and, except with Disclosing Party’s written consent,
      shall (i) not use any Confidential Information of Disclosing Party for any
      purpose outside the scope of this Agreement and (ii) limit access to
      Confidential Information of Disclosing Party to those of its and its
      Authorized Contractors, Affiliates’ employees, contractors and agents who
      need such access for purposes consistent with this Agreement and who have
      a duty or obligation of confidentiality no less stringent than that set
      forth herein.
      <br /><br />

      8.4. Compelled Disclosure. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential
      Information of the Disclosing Party to the extent required by applicable
      law, regulation or legal process, provided that the Receiving Party (i)
      provides prompt written notice to the extent legally permitted, (ii)
      provides reasonable assistance, at Disclosing Party's cost, in the event
      the Disclosing Party wishes to oppose the disclosure, and (iii) limits
      disclosure to that required by law, regulation or legal process.

      demand, suit, or proceeding made or brought against Customer by a third
      party alleging that the use of the Subscription Services hereunder

      Customer of all liability); and (c) provides to Tina Pokuaah Consultancy &
      Training all reasonable assistance, at Tina Pokuaah Consultancy &
      Training’s expense. In the event of a Claim Against Customer, or if Tina

      Training may in Tina Pokuaah Consultancy & Training’s sole discretion and

      (iv) or Customer’s breach of this Agreement.
      <br /><br />

      proceeding made or brought against Tina Pokuaah Consultancy & Training by
      a third party alleging that Customer Data or Customer Application violates
      applicable law or a third party’s rights (a "Claim Against Tina Pokuaah
      Consultancy & Training"); provided that Tina Pokuaah Consultancy &
      Training (a) promptly gives Customer written notice of the Claim Against
      Tina Pokuaah Consultancy & Training; (b) gives Customer sole control of
      the defense and settlement of the Claim Against Tina Pokuaah Consultancy &

      <br /><br />

      12.2. Renewal of Subscription Services. Except as otherwise specified in

      thereunder shall become due and payable. In no event shall any termination
      relieve Customer of the obligation to pay all fees payable to Tina Pokuaah

      termination. Upon termination of an Order Form or this Agreement for any
      reason, Customer’s right to access and use the Subscription Services

      obligations of the parties hereunder that by their nature are reasonably
      intended to survive termination or expiration, shall survive any
      termination or expiration of this Agreement.
      <br /><br />

      13. NOTICES, GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION
      <br /><br />

      13.1. Manner of Giving Notice. Except as otherwise specified in this
      Agreement, all legal notices of default, breach or termination (“Legal
      Notices”) hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been
      given upon (i) personal delivery, (ii) the fifth business day after being
      sent by certified mail return receipt requested, or (iii) the first
      business day after sending by a generally recognized international
      guaranteed overnight delivery service. Each party shall send all Legal
      Notices to the other party at the address set forth in the applicable
      Order Form or SOW, as such party may update such information from time to
      time, with, in the case of notices sent by Customer, a copy sent to the
      Tina Pokuaah Consultancy & Training Legal Department at the address first
      set forth above. Billing-related notices to Customer will be addressed to
      the relevant billing contact designated by Customer on the applicable
      Order.
      <br /><br />

      13.2. Governing Law and Jurisdiction. If Customer is entering into this
      Agreement from the UK or a European Union member country, then this
      Agreement is governed by the laws of England and subject to the exclusive
      jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales. If Customer is entering
      into this Agreement from Australia, then this Agreement is governed by the

      construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of
      Massachusetts, excluding its conflicts of law rules. Any civil action or
      legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be
      brought in the courts of record of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in
      Suffolk County or the United States District Court, Eastern District of

      court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties acknowledge that any
      unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information or any actual or
      alleged infringement of such party’s or third party’s intellectual
      property rights might cause the other party to suffer irreparable harm for
      which damages would be an inadequate remedy and that, in such event, the
      aggrieved party may seek, in addition to any other available remedies,
      injunctive and other equitable relief in any state, federal, or national
      court of competent jurisdiction, without bond and without the necessity of
      showing actual monetary damages. The United Nations Convention on

      of Jury Trial. Each party hereby waives any right to jury trial in

      related to this Agreement.

      14.9. Waiver. No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right
      under this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of that right.
      <br /><br />

      14.10. Force Majeure. Neither party shall be liable under this Agreement
      for delays or failures to perform the Services or this Agreement due to
      causes beyond its reasonable control. Such delays include, but are not

      orders, or regulation, strikes or labor difficulties, to the extent not
      occasioned by the fault or negligence of the delayed party. Any such
      excuse for delay shall last only as long as the event remains beyond the
      reasonable control of the delayed party. The delayed party shall use its
      best efforts to minimize the delays caused by any such event beyond its
      reasonable control. If the force majeure event continues for more than

      modified by the court and interpreted so as best to accomplish the
      objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by
      law, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in
      effect.
      <br /><br />

      14.12. Assignment. Neither party may assign its rights and obligations
      hereunder, either in whole or in part, whether by operation of law or
      otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other party.
      Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may assign this Agreement in
      its entirety (including all Order Forms and SOWs), without consent of the
      other party, to its Affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition,
      corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its
      assets not involving a direct competitor of the other party. Subject to
      the foregoing, this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the
      parties, their respective successors, and permitted assigns.
      <br /><br />

      14.13. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
      between the parties as it relates to the subject matter and supersedes all
      prior and contemporaneous agreements, proposals, or representations,
      written or oral, concerning or relating to the same. Except as otherwise
      provided herein, no modification, amendment, or waiver of any provision of
      this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by both
      parties. To the extent of any conflict or inconsistency between the
      provisions of this Agreement, the Documentation, any Order Form or SOW,
      the terms of such Order Form or SOW shall prevail. Notwithstanding any
      language to the contrary therein, no terms or conditions stated in a PO,
      payment system, other order documentation or otherwise (excluding Order
      Forms and/or SOWs) shall be incorporated into or form any part of this
      Agreement, and all such terms or conditions shall be null and void.
